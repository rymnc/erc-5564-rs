# Example

Feel free to play around with the `curves` that are exported by the `stealth_address_kit` crate. The following example demonstrates how to generate a stealth address using the `secp256r1` curve.

Update the `Cargo.toml` file to include the features/curves that you would like to use.

Supported Curves: [here](../README.md#Existing-Implementations)
